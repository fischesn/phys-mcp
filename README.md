# phys-MCP v3.0

`phys-MCP` is a substrate-aware control-plane prototype for exposing heterogeneous **physical neural network (PNN)** resources as discoverable, invocable, and monitorable software-visible backends.

The system is designed for settings in which materially different computational substrates cannot be treated as ordinary stateless accelerators. Instead, they expose distinct I/O modalities, timing regimes, lifecycle constraints, observability limits, and health or validity conditions. `phys-MCP` provides a single orchestration layer above such backends while preserving these substrate-specific semantics.

This repository contains:

- a Python reference implementation of the `phys-MCP` control plane
- representative local prototype backends for chemical, wetware, and fast edge-style execution
- an externalized remote edge backend path
- a real API-backed integration path for **Cortical Labs**
- minimal **Gemini-based** and **Ollama-based** agents that plan and execute tasks through `phys-MCP`
- demos, tests, and evaluation scripts

The current code base should be understood as a **research prototype**: it is operational, structured, and demonstrable, but not a production runtime.

---

## 1. Purpose of the system

`phys-MCP` exists to answer a practical systems problem:

> How can heterogeneous physical neural substrates be exposed to software in a way that supports discovery, task matching, invocation, monitoring, and lifecycle-aware control without flattening away the properties that actually matter?

The prototype treats physical AI resources as **managed backends** rather than opaque one-off lab integrations. The central idea is that software should be able to ask:

- What backends are available?
- Which task types do they support?
- Which input and output modalities do they require?
- What timing regime do they operate in?
- Are they ready right now?
- What telemetry do they expose?
- Can they be reset, recalibrated, or reused safely?
- Can an agent or orchestrator choose among them in a principled way?

`phys-MCP` answers these questions through a substrate-aware descriptor model, a matcher, an orchestrator, and backend-specific adapters.

---

## 2. High-level architecture

The implementation follows a three-part structure:

### Control plane
The control plane is responsible for:

- backend discovery
- task-to-substrate matching
- policy checking
- directed or capability-based invocation
- validation and fallback handling
- collection of normalized result and telemetry information

### Twin / runtime state
The prototype keeps state that is relevant for runtime decisions, such as:

- readiness
- health
- drift-related signals
- telemetry freshness
- calibration- or validity-like metadata

This is not a full digital twin framework, but it is enough to make runtime state visible to the control logic.

### Data / backend integration layer
The data-plane side is implemented through adapters and backend-specific client logic:

- local synthetic backends for representative substrate regimes
- a remote edge path via HTTP
- a real API-backed path via the Cortical Labs CL SDK / simulator
- a foundation for additional future integrations

---

## 3. What the prototype can do

### 3.1 Discover heterogeneous backends
The orchestrator can enumerate backends described through a shared descriptor model.

Each backend publishes information such as:

- substrate class
- supported task types
- input/output contracts
- timing semantics
- lifecycle/reset semantics
- telemetry fields
- locality and tenancy constraints
- health and observability characteristics

### 3.2 Match tasks to backends
Tasks can be routed in two ways:

- **capability-driven**: let the matcher select the best compatible backend
- **directed**: explicitly target a backend such as `cortical-labs-backend`

Matching is based on descriptor compatibility and runtime signals rather than on mere endpoint presence.

### 3.3 Execute tasks with telemetry-aware control
A task execution can include:

- preparation / readiness checks
- session opening
- backend invocation
- postcondition validation
- telemetry collection before and after execution
- optional fallback to another backend

### 3.4 Exercise representative synthetic backend regimes
The prototype includes three core local regimes:

- **chemical backend**
- **wetware backend**
- **edge backend**

These are not intended as faithful physical simulators. Their role is to exercise control-plane behavior under clearly different operational conditions.

### 3.5 Use an externalized backend path
The remote edge path demonstrates that the same control-plane logic also works across an explicit service boundary.

### 3.6 Use a real Cortical Labs path
The repository includes a real adapter and client path for the **Cortical Labs CL API / CL SDK simulator**.

Through this path, `phys-MCP` can:

- open a CL session
- submit a simple stimulation/recording task
- collect normalized result data
- capture structured recording artifact metadata
- expose readiness, health, backend latency, observation latency, and recording path as telemetry

### 3.7 Use LLM-based agents
The repository also includes:

- a **Gemini-based agent**
- an **Ollama-based agent**

These agents can:

- discover backends through `phys-MCP`
- ask an LLM to produce a structured execution plan
- execute that plan only via `phys-MCP`
- receive the result and telemetry
- ask the model to summarize the outcome

The agents do **not** call substrate APIs directly. This is intentional: `phys-MCP` remains the sole control plane.

google-genai
requests
pytest
```

Optional but useful:

```txt
jupyterlab
ipywidgets
```

### 5.3 Runtime configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root. A typical starting point is:

```dotenv
# Cortical Labs SDK / Simulator
CL_SDK_DURATION_SEC=60
CL_SDK_RANDOM_SEED=42
CL_SDK_ACCELERATED_TIME=1
CL_SDK_SAMPLE_MEAN=170
CL_SDK_SPIKE_PERCENTILE=99.995

# Optional replay input
# CL_SDK_REPLAY_PATH=
# CL_SDK_REPLAY_START_OFFSET=0

# Optional visualisation / websocket support
# CL_SDK_WEBSOCKET=1
# CL_SDK_WEBSOCKET_PORT=1025
# CL_SDK_WEBSOCKET_HOST=127.0.0.1

# Gemini
GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE

# Ollama
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen2.5:7b-instruct
```

Important: the same Python environment that runs `phys-MCP` must also have `cl-sdk` installed.

---

## 6. Basic smoke tests

### 6.1 SDK smoke test

```bash
python scripts/cl_smoketest.py
```

### 6.2 Stimulation and recording smoke test

```bash
python scripts/cl_stim_record_test.py
```

These tests verify the raw Cortical Labs path before the adapter, orchestrator, and agent layers are exercised.

---

## 7. Main demos

### 7.1 Discovery and matching demo

```bash
python -m demos.demo_discovery_and_matching
```

This demonstrates descriptor publication, backend discovery, and matcher decisions across the representative backend set.

### 7.2 Invocation and telemetry demo

```bash
python -m demos.demo_invocation_and_telemetry
```

This demonstrates execution and telemetry collection on the representative backend set.

### 7.3 Fallback and recalibration demo

```bash
python -m demos.demo_fallback_and_recalibration
```

This demonstrates recovery-oriented behavior such as fallback and recalibration handling.

### 7.4 Cortical Labs adapter demo

```bash
python -m demos.demo_cortical_labs_adapter
```

This demo exercises:

- orchestrator creation
- backend discovery
- directed task targeting `cortical-labs-backend`
- backend preparation
- invocation through the CL client
- result and telemetry collection

Typical result fields include:

- `response_fingerprint`
- `stim_channel`
- `stim_amplitude_ua`
- `observation_window_ms`
- `recording_artifact`

Typical telemetry includes:

- `readiness_state`
- `health_status`
- `backend_latency_ms`
- `observation_latency_ms`
- `recording_path`
- `channel_count`
- `fps`

---

## 8. Evaluation scripts

### 8.1 Run all bundled evaluations

```bash
python -m evaluation.run_all_evaluations
```

### 8.2 Real Cortical runtime evaluation

```bash
python -m evaluation.evaluate_cortical_runtime
```

This performs several directed runs against the Cortical Labs integration path and stores JSON/CSV results under `evaluation/results/`.

### 8.3 Gemini agent evaluation

```bash
python -m evaluation.evaluate_gemini_agent
```

This performs several agent-driven runs and stores JSON/CSV results under `evaluation/results/`.

### 8.4 Additional evaluation scripts

The repository also contains dedicated scripts for:

- `evaluation.evaluate_externalized_backend`
- `evaluation.evaluate_failure_campaign`
- `evaluation.evaluate_matching`
- `evaluation.evaluate_matching_baselines`
- `evaluation.evaluate_overhead`
- `evaluation.evaluate_portability`

These scripts can be run individually from the project root with `python -m ...`.

---

## 9. Agent-based access

The repository provides two minimal agent clients on top of `phys-MCP`:

- **Gemini-based agent**
- **Ollama-based agent**

Both agents follow the same principle:

1. discover resources through `phys-MCP`
2. ask an LLM to produce a structured execution plan
3. execute that plan only through the `phys-MCP` orchestrator
4. summarize the result and telemetry in natural language

The agents do **not** call backend APIs such as Cortical Labs directly.  
`phys-MCP` remains the sole control plane.

### 9.1 Gemini agent

Expected location:

```text
agent/gemini_agent.py
```

Requirements:
- `google-genai`
- `python-dotenv`
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env`

Run from the project root:

```bash
python -m agent.gemini_agent
```

This agent is useful when a stronger cloud LLM is available and a Gemini API key is already configured.

### 9.2 Ollama agent

Expected location:

```text
agent/ollama_agent.py
```

Requirements:
- `requests`
- a running Ollama server
- a locally installed model, for example:
  - `qwen2.5:7b-instruct`
  - `qwen2.5:14b-instruct`

Typical setup:

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5:7b-instruct
python -m agent.ollama_agent
```

This agent is the preferred free and local option for immediate experimentation.

### 9.3 Current scope

The current agent implementations are intentionally minimal. They focus on:

- backend discovery
- structured planning
- directed execution against the Cortical Labs path
- concise result summarization

They are operational demonstrations of **agent-facing control-plane access**, not full autonomous multi-agent systems.

---

## 10. Tests

Run the bundled tests with:

```bash
pytest -q
```

For the Cortical Labs adapter specifically:

```bash
pytest tests/test_cortical_labs_adapter.py -q
```

The tests validate descriptor structure, adapter behavior, and integration assumptions. They complement, but do not replace, the real simulator runs.

---

## 11. How the Cortical Labs integration works

The Cortical Labs path consists of two layers:

### `backends/cortical/cl_client.py`
This is the low-level client wrapper around the CL SDK. It handles:

- session open/close
- simple stimulation/recording cycles
- health/readiness retrieval
- recording artifact normalization

### `adapters/cortical_labs_adapter.py`
This is the `phys-MCP` adapter layer. It translates between:

- `phys-MCP` task and telemetry semantics
- and the CL client’s concrete runtime calls

This separation keeps backend-specific API handling in the client and control-plane semantics in the adapter.

---

## 12. How the agent integrations work

### Planning
The LLM receives:
- a planning prompt
- a user goal

It returns structured JSON such as:

```json
{
  "action": "run_cortical_screen",
  "arguments": {
    "preferred_backend_id": "cortical-labs-backend",
    "channel": 24,
    "amplitude": 0.6,
    "observation_window_ms": 100,
    "pre_delay_ms": 10,
    "allow_fallback": false,
    "human_supervision_available": true
  },
  "rationale": "..."
}
```

### Execution
The agent converts this plan into a `phys-MCP` task and calls the orchestrator.

### Summarization
The LLM then receives the structured result and telemetry and produces a short human-readable explanation.

This keeps the LLM in a **planning and summarization role**, while all actual backend control remains in `phys-MCP`.

---

## 13. Recommended workflow for development

Use this order:

```bash
python scripts/cl_smoketest.py
python scripts/cl_stim_record_test.py
python -m demos.demo_cortical_labs_adapter
pytest tests/test_cortical_labs_adapter.py -q
python -m evaluation.evaluate_cortical_runtime
python -m agent.gemini_agent
```

or, for the free local agent path:

```bash
python -m agent.ollama_agent
```

If the first two scripts fail, there is no point debugging the adapter or the agents yet.

---

## 14. Known scope and limitations

This repository is a research prototype and should be interpreted accordingly.

### What it already demonstrates
- substrate-aware backend discovery
- task matching and directed execution
- telemetry-aware control
- an externalized remote backend path
- a real API-backed Cortical Labs integration path
- working Gemini- and Ollama-based agents on top of `phys-MCP`

### What it does not claim
- production readiness
- broad performance benchmarking of real wetware systems
- full digital-twin lifecycle management
- general-purpose autonomous multi-agent orchestration
- complete support for all physical substrate classes

The Cortical Labs integration should currently be understood as:
- a real wetware-facing API path
- successfully exercised end to end
- useful for research and demonstration
- still narrow in scope

---

## 15. Practical debugging advice

### If `cl-sdk` import fails
Check that you are running the command inside the correct project virtual environment.

### If the Cortical demo fails
Re-run:

```bash
python scripts/cl_smoketest.py
python scripts/cl_stim_record_test.py
```

before debugging the adapter.

### If the Gemini agent fails
Check:

- `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- `google-genai` installation
- whether `python -m agent.gemini_agent` is executed from the project root
- whether the Cortical Labs demo already works independently

### If the Ollama agent fails
Check:

- whether `ollama serve` is running
- whether the configured model is installed
- `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`
- `OLLAMA_MODEL`
- whether the Cortical Labs demo already works independently

---

## 16. Summary

`phys-MCP v3.0` is a unified research prototype for treating heterogeneous physical AI resources as discoverable, invocable, telemetry-aware backends under a common control plane.

Its current strengths are:

- coherent substrate-aware control semantics
- a working real API-backed Cortical Labs path
- reproducible runtime evaluation of that path
- and minimal but functional Gemini- and Ollama-based agents on top of the same control plane

That makes the repository useful both as:

- a systems research prototype
- and a practical experimental platform for future integrations and demonstrations
